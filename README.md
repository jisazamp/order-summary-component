## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One of the biggest learnings with this challenge was positioning the SVG in the background, as it's a CSS property I haven't worked with much.

### Continued development

As I mentioned before, I want to improve and reinforce my knowledge in the handling of backgrounds and SVG manipulation.
